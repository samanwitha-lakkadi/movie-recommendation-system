Movie Recommendation System using machine learning (Python)

Description:

Recommendation Systems are a sort of information filtering system because they increase the quality of search results by presenting things that are more relevant to the search item or are connected to the user's search history. They are used to forecast a user's rating or preference for an item. Almost every major tech firm has used them in some capacity: Amazon uses them to propose items to consumers, YouTube uses them to choose which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses them to recommend sites to like and people to follow. Furthermore, organizations such as Netflix and Spotify rely heavily on the performance of their recommendation engines for revenue and success.
